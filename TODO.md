## Game mechanics
* try to stack as many containers as possible on incoming ships with tower crane
* time is short
  * pay late fees if ships have to wait for too long
* each ship gives certain amount of money based on amount of cargo (x (20ft) - 2x (40ft) per container)
* two different sized containers (20ft(6.09m) - 40ft(12.19m))

## Bonus goals
* 20ft/40ft high rise (259cm instead)
* 6ft and 10ft containers on harder difficulty
* Upgrade to hammerhead and gantry cranes
* Multiple cranes
* Ships with multiple destinations so you need to stack in order
* reefers (refrigerated containers that need power outlet)
* handle input unloading as well
